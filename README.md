# MamaCSS

A simple and style independent CSS grid layout framework to build awesome user interfaces atop.

## Browser Support

Mama CSS is built using the CSS grid specification. Refer to the (https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid "caniuse.com") page for CSS grid browser support. Note that if you're concerned about supporting <=IE11, first off I'm sorry, and second, you'll only find partial support for CSS grid.
